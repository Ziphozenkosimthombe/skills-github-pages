## My first time writing C language code
  - my first time writing c so i was introduce to c by ALXSE it was my first time learning to code, so we were just introduce to c language so it was just mind blowing that i can just tell the computor to do something that i want and with the way that i tell it to do so my first hello world code with C was just mind blowing to me. and what i did i understand is that the computor will always do what to are telling it to do. so thank you for ALXSE just to teach me the amazing programming language which is C language.
